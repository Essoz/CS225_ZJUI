## Improved Centralized Queueing System | CS225 MP 2
## Author: Group 10 | Tianyu Zhang

    At this time, since the system design and data structures will be discussed during the presentation,
this README file will only tell you how to run this whole program.

How to run this program?
    Different from CA1, you do not to open two terminals and run both local and central code at the same time.
This time, you need to do following:

1. Open the Local registry, then make and run test.exe only in the Local folder. You might see 64 output .csv file 
   are generated together in the Local/Submit registry. These are the input files to the central queue.
2. Then open the ex2 folder since the main function is in that folder. Make and run the central.exe, this time you
   will directly see the weekly report and monthly report based on different requirements.
3. As for other contents, ex1 contains the database schema including the methods. ex2 contains the central queue (modified),
   ex3 contains the index data structures: B+Tree, BTree and HashTable.
