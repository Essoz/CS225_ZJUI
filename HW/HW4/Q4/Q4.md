Preparations for the exercise:  
> $\rm INSERT$ and $\rm UNION$ will have changed run time due to $\rm consolidate$. 
>
> For $\rm INSERT$, 
> the complexity is bounded by $O(\log(n))$
> 
> For $\rm UNION$,
> the complexity is bounded by $O(Max\{\log{n}, \log{m}\})$ if we denote the sizes of the two heaps by $n$ and $m$.
> 
> For $\rm MIN$,
> the complexity is O(1)
> 
> For $\rm ExtractMIN$,
> the complexity is given by $O(\log(n))$ according to our textbook.


Amortized Analysis:  
**Note**:  
- In our consideration, the operation of UNION is not counted.
- $R$ represents the size of the root list, $n$ represents the size of the heap structure.

$Insert$  (just forget about the following content if incorrect)

The worst case happens when a node is inserted into the heaps $root\_i.degree = i$ for all roots in the heap structure, which leads to a "collapse" of the heaps (all heaps are consolidated into one giant heap). The complexity in this case is obviously $O(R) = O(\log{n})$.

If we only consider insertions, then the total complexity of insertions for a McGee heap is upper bounded by
$$
\sum^R_{i = 1}\sum^i_{j = 1}{(\log{j}+1)} 
$$
For amortized complexity, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
Insert(node) & = O(\frac{\sum^{\log{n}}_{i = 1}\sum^i_{j = 1}{(\log{j} + 1)}}{n})\\
& = O(\frac{\log{\prod^{\log{n}}_{i=1}i!}}{n} + \frac{\log{n}(\log{n}+1)}n)\\
\end{aligned}
$$
