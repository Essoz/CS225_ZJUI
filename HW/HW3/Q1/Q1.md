# Exercise 1
### 1.1
The minimum cannot be determined unless all $n$ values have been visited. Then the number of comparisons must be $n-1$ because when traversing the array, the first encountered entry is not compared.
### 1.2
Consider a min-heap

All leaf nodes in the heap represent all entries in the array. Each internal node (nodes with degree 2) has the smaller entry between its two children, which stands for a comparison. Then the number of comparisons, i.e. the number of internal nodes, is given by $L = (n-1)\cdot I + 1$.  
Plug in $L = n$ (n stands for size), $n = 2$, (n stands for the arity of the tree) then $I = n - 1$   
Namely, determining the minimum entry take $n-1$ comparisons.

Now, to determine the second minimum, we need to compare the minimum to all elements that are ever compared to it. Then the number of comparisons is given by the height of the heap, which is $log(n)$

Thus the minimum number of comparisons needed is $n-1 + \log(n)$
