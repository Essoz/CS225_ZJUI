Your function declarations are in the "avl.h" file,
and your implementations should be in the "solution.cpp" file.
You may want to add some helper function declarations in the 
"avl.h" file.
Use "test.cpp" to test your output.

Notice the return value of these functions is a pointer to an
AList<T>, that is why I included "alist.h" as well.

Moreover, you might want to use queue in your BFS implementation,
note that "fifo.h" is also included.
